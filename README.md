## Building

[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) will allow you to build either a server or client pack.
Please refer to their tutorials page for more info.

## Server

`serverpack/start.sh` is useful for starting a server on linux, mac or another \*nix flavor. It will also handle procuring the files for you.

`serverpack/start.ps1` is the Powershell 7.4 version and will be the script windows users want to use.<br/>
If your system is missing Powershell version 7.4 (or greater) please refer to the installation instructions provided
by Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4).
